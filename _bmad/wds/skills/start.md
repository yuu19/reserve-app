# /start — Session Resume Skill

**Invocation:** `/start` (also called automatically from agent activation files)
**Works for:** any agent (saga, freya, mimir, idun)

---

## Purpose

Detects whether a previous session was saved for the active agent and offers to resume it. If no state file exists, proceeds silently with the normal activation sequence.

---

## Behavior When Invoked

### 1. Detect Active Agent

Identify which agent is currently active. Look for `_bmad/_state/[agent].md` in the current project repo.

### 2. Load State

**Primary: local file**

Check for `_bmad/_state/[agent].md` in the project root. This is the authoritative source.

**Optional: Agent Space enhancement**

If Agent Space is configured, also call `session-start` — but only as an enhancement, never a requirement:

```bash
curl -X POST "{BASE_URL}/functions/v1/session-start" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "[agent]",
    "project": "[repo-folder-name]",
    "model_target": "claude"
  }'
```

If the call succeeds and `presence.last_status_report` is present, use it as the state source only if it is more recent than the local file (e.g., previous session was on a different machine). If the call fails for any reason, continue silently with the local file.

The response may also contain:
- `session_id` — register as active session ID if present
- `instructions` — skill chain overrides. Load any levels present.
- `files` — cached design-process folder. Display file count if any.
- `messages` — unread messages. Show if any.

**Fallback chain:** local `_bmad/_state/[agent].md` → Agent Space presence → fresh start

### 3. If State Found

Display the previous session summary clearly:

```
⏸ Previous session found ([date from Wrapped field])

Where I left off: [content from "Where I Left Off" section]
Next action: [content from "Next Action" section]

Resume where we left off, or start fresh?
```

Wait for the user's response.

**If resume:**
- Read the full state file, including the Context and Open Questions sections
- Jump straight to the Next Action — no scanning, no re-introduction, no status report
- Treat the context as already established — don't re-explain what was already known

**If fresh:**
- Proceed with the normal activation sequence for this agent
- Do not delete the state file (the user may want to refer back to it)

### 4. If Nothing Found

No local file, no Agent Space record — proceed with the normal activation sequence. Do not mention /start or the absence of a state file.

---

## Notes

- The state file is written by `/wrap`. If no `/wrap` was run at the end of the previous session, there will be no file to find.
- The state file lives at `_bmad/_state/[agent].md` relative to the project root.
- Agent Space is optional — local file works without it.
- On resume, prioritize getting back to work quickly. The user already knows the context — they don't need a recap beyond what's shown in the summary.
